# Test Score Prediction AI

## Problem
Students often wonder how study time and sleep affect test performance.
This project explores whether a computer can predict a test score using
hours studied and hours slept.

## Solution
I trained a simple machine learning model using sample data.
The model looks at patterns between study time, sleep, and test scores,
then predicts a score for a new student.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Sheets
- GitHub

## Results
The AI successfully predicted a test score based on input values.
Example output:
"The AI predicted a test score of 82.6 for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours."

## Learning
I learned how machine learning models are trained using real data
and how Python can be used to build and publish AI projects.
